                    <p>When I was a kid,I was a marvel fan.I was so caught into the movie "Venom" is because Venom is the first character
                        that caught me into the marvel universe.The way i knew the Venom is from the comic book " Spider man adventures ‚Äù 
                        during the age of 8. So then, I was so deep in love with Venom, the style, the looks, the motivation , his reason of birth
                        etc. When i heard recently that Venom recieved a Live action production, i was so freaking excited that i watched the movie
                        right after the movie release in Taiwan.

                         We should be grateful for everything in our lives-the good and the bad, the happy and the sad, the white and the black.
                            although it is simple to be happy when life gives us roses, we should also be prepared for the thorns.
